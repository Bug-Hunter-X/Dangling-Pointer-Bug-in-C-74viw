This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in C: Dangling Pointers after freeing dynamically allocated memory. The bug.c file contains code that correctly allocates memory, copies data, and frees the allocated memory. However, a dangling pointer is created, which can lead to memory corruption or unexpected behavior. The bugSolution.c file demonstrates the corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of careful memory management in C programming and the need to set pointers to NULL after freeing memory to prevent such vulnerabilities.
